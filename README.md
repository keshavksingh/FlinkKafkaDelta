This Repository demonstrates Stream processing for events posted on Azure EventHub. We demonstrate EventHub's Apache Kafka endpoint protocol and with Apache Flink cluster on **Azure HDInsight on AKS** process the streams. We Sink the data in delta formatted delta Lake on ADLS Gen2. Lastly we then create a short-cut on Microsoft Fabric and with its SQL endpoint demonstrate REAL-TIME analytics.
